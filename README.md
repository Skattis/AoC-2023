# AoC-2023
I will post my solutions to Advent of Code 2023 but I will probably not be able to complete all days.
Btw, i took the 'Einf√ºhrung in die Informatik" class last wintersemester (22/23, but have not really been programming since).

I feel like day one was pretty hard for a day one.

Day two was easier than the first day but my solution was quite messy because I wasn't using Regex or some fundamental String functions so I will post it when it's cleaned up and improved. I uploaded it now, one day later and it's still not too pretty because I basically copied my code from the first part for the second part but maybe it's easier to read like that.

Day 3 was pretty hard for me again. I haven't solved the second part yet because I am missing an edge case which didn't occur in all the tests I ran. I will look at it again sometime in the next week. Well my solution isn't pretty.

Day 4 was easier again, still I always write duplicate code for part one and two and should probably start solving both parts in the same loops. And I have given up on making my code pretty and it's not understandable I probably won't know what I was doing if I look back on the 'hard' problems.
