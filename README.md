# AoC-2023
I will post my solutions to Advent of Code 2023 but I will probably not be able to complete all days.
Btw, i took the 'Einf√ºhrung in die Informatik" class last wintersemester (22/23, but have not really been programming since).

I feel like day one was pretty hard for a day one.
Day two was easier than the first day but my solution was quite messy because I wasn't using Regex or some fundamental String functions so I will post it when it's cleaned up and improved.
